                My name is Gwanwoo Lee, and my preferred name is Kyle. Iâ€™m extroverted, multi-talented, and adventurous. I love making new friends through sports and musical activities while making sure that I challenge myself. I hope to contribute to the community of the schools with my sociable personality, versatility, and enthusiasm. Surrounded by motivated students from diverse backgrounds and cultures, I hope to be able to build strong relationships, learn better academic skills, and discover more about myself.

                Since I was little, I have played many kinds of sports, including soccer, basketball, swimming, skiing, and tennis. I appreciate the friendships I have made while playing for the school soccer team, swimming team, and club basketball team for many years. Being a team member and participating in numerous competitions have taught me not just athletic skills but also how to form valuable relationships with other team members.

                Meanwhile, I also love challenges, since they are great opportunities for both learning and growth. Getting into Chadwick International School has been the most challenging and proud experience in my life. Despite the competitive admissions procedure, I only had limited time to prepare for it. Even after I got in, adapting to an entirely different academic environment remained challenging. Everything felt so different from my previous Korean public school.
